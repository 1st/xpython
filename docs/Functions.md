# Functions

Function is a logical block of program, that allows to make program more readable. Function allows
to define small piece of code and then use it in multiple places, avoiding repeated parts of code if few places.

Function name always starts from a lower-case letter, like a [variable](Variables.md).


## Examples

```python
def func_name(Int age, Str name) -> Str
  return "Your name is {} and you have {} years".format(name, Str(age))
```
