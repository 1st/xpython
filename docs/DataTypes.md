# Data Types

We have list of pre-defined data types, that available in each xPython program.
If you need to define your own complex data type - visit [classes](Classes.md) page
to find how to create your own data type.

First of all - in xPython all data types starts from the capital letter.

## Basic data types

 - **Bool** - boolean value *(True or False)*.
 - **Int** - integer variable *(64 bit)*.
 - **Float** - floating point number. *(Note: check, can we use float instead of decimal,
   or we need to provide this data type as well).*
 - **Str** - unicode string.
